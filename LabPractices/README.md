# Lab Practices

This folder contains a collection of smaller Java labs completed as part of the coursework.  Each lab demonstrates core programming concepts such as arrays, methods, string parsing, and control flow.

## Files

- **PeopleWeights.java**  
  Prompts user to enter five weights.  Calculates and displays total weight, average weight, and maximum weight using an array.

- **LabProgram.java**  
  Calculates the cost of driving a given number of miles.  Demonstrates method creation and reuse.

- **ParseStrings.java**  
  Parses a user-entered string with two comma-separated words.  Handles input validation and loops until the user enters `q` to quit.

## Concepts Covered

- Arrays and loops
- Method creation and reuse
- String manipulation and trimming
- Input validation and loop control
