# Paint Calculator

This project includes two Java programs that calculate the amount of paint needed to cover a wall, based on user input for height and width.

## Files

- **Paint1.java**  
  Validates user input and calculates wall area and paint required in gallons.

- **Paint2.java**  
  Extends Paint1 by adding logic to calculate the number of paint cans needed, rounding up to the nearest whole number.

## Concepts Covered

- User input and exception handling with `Scanner`
- Arithmetic operations and formulas
- Input validation using `try-catch` blocks
- Rounding with `Math.ceil()`
