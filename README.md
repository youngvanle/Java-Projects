# Java Projects

This repository contains beginner to intermediate Java projects developed while learning core programming concepts in Java.  Each project focuses on specific areas such as object-oriented programming, user input handling, arrays, methods, and control flow.

## Project Folders

### 📁 GraziosoRescueSystem
A menu-driven application that simulates an animal intake and reservation system.  Demonstrates inheritance, object creation, user input handling, and basic data management using array lists.

### 📁 PaintCalculator
Calculates the area of a wall and determines how much paint is needed, including the number of full cans required. Builds progressively across two program versions.  Focuses on arithmetic operations and user input validation.

### 📁 ShoppingCart
Prompts the user to enter two items, then calculates and displays the total cost.  Uses a custom class with fields, setters/getters, and an object-oriented approach.

### 📁 LabPractices
A collection of smaller Java labs designed to reinforce core programming skills:
- **DrivingCost.java** – Method-based driving cost calculator
- **ParseStrings.java** – Parses comma-separated strings with input validation
- **PeopleWeights.java** – Uses arrays to calculate total, average, and max weight

## Topics Covered

- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Custom classes and encapsulation
- Input validation and error handling
- Arrays and loop structures
- Method creation and parameter passing
- String manipulation and parsing
- Console-based I/O

## Background

These projects were created as part of a university-level course focused on foundational Java development.  Each file reflects hands-on experience with programming fundamentals through structured, console-based assignments.
